        <h3>Carrot Cake Coffee Cake</h3>
        <p>Carrot Cake Coffee Cake! A super easy batter loaded with shredded 
            carrots, topped with a thick crumbly cinnamony streusel, and
            finished with a melty sweet honey butter.</p>

        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4> 
            <ol>
                <li>Pulse the carrots in a food processor. I hate grating things,
                    especially carrots. I’m not even sorry. Put me on the record. 
                    I said it. So, I am not going to make you grate anything! Just
                    run your peeled carrots through the food processor, and if you
                    don't have a food processor, what are you even doing?
                    You need this post.</li> 
                <li>Make your batter. Grab a large bowl and mix up a very simple
                    batter with eggs, flour, sugar, cinnamon, and (wait for it)
                    butter. BUTTER. Carrot cakes traditionally use vegetable oil.
                    But newsflash: BUTTER IS DELICIOUS. So today we use butter.
                    Obviously.</li> 
                <li>Mix up your streusel layer. Bring all your streusel 
                    ingredients together in a small bowl and pulse things up 
                    until you get a pebble-like texture.</li>
                <li>Bake! Grease your pan or put some parchment paper in there. 
                    Now it gets baked under an aggressively thick layer of streusel.
                    You can test the cake doneness by sticking a toothpick in the
                    center. If the toothpick comes out clean, it's good to go!</li>
                 <li>Major YUM! Whatcha waiting for? Drizzle some honey butter on
                     (or, like some readers have done, a layer of cream cheese 
                     frosting!) and let's gooo!</li>
